# CuraScripts
Extension scripts for the Cura slicer (3D printing)

# DisplayFileAndLayersV2
This script is an alternative (and based on) to the original DisplayFilenameAndLayerOnLCD.py script by Amanda de Castilho, that comes preinstalled with Cura.

The script is tested with Cura 4.1.0, but will probably work with version 3 as well.

To install:
  * open Cura > Help menu > Show Configuration Folder
  * Save script in this folder.
After installation it should appear in the Post-processing/Modify G-code extension.
